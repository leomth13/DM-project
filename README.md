# DM-project
This repository hosts everything related to the coding part of my bachelor's final project. 
The file named 'Temp_final' contains my entire Python code for solving the radiation temperature in the early universe in the first part, and everything related to dark matter in the second part. Even if it's not super optimized it should run properly (there are some explanations but running everything won't display all the results my the paper).
